# Emma Olson-Rossow Professional Portfolio

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a professional portfolio showcasing my skills and displaying a easy to navigate record of my developed & deployed applications.

This allows collaborators and potential employers to navigate through my work & learn more about me in a more user-friendly way than simply browsing through GitHub repositories.
